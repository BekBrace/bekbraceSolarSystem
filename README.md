Solar System Animation
This project utilizes the Paper.js library to create a captivating solar system animation. The animation includes the sun and planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—each with its unique color gradient and orbit. The planets move along their orbits, and a starry background with pulsating glow adds to the visual appeal. To get started, include the Paper.js library in your project and open the index.html file in a web browser. The animation showcases the beauty of our solar system through an engaging visual experience. Contributions are welcome, so feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to enhance the project.
